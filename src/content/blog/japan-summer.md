# some ramblings

I told one of my close friends that I would write a blog post about my summer in Tokyo. Here I am sitting in the Tokyo Metropolitan Library, and I'm finally getting around to it. On the way here, I passed several primary schools. The gates were open. Children were playing baseball on the field, shouting in Japanese (of which I could pick up traces). Their game had no clear beginning and no end. 

The library held a disciplined quiet. Nothing was accidental -- the distance between seats, the timing of footsteps. Bags were placed beneath chairs and not touched again. People arrived, badged in, and remained.

The room replaced the effort of navigating the city with the discipline of staying. The quiet did not offer relief so much as structure. It set a pace and expected it to be kept.

# the promise

When I told my friends I was going to Tokyo for the summer, they reacted as if I had already returned. They were excited for me, sometimes more than I was. I remember nodding and accepting their enthusiasm like a gift I don't know where to put. 

By then I had learned an unfortunate habit: to feel things late. 

Most people I know come to Japan the way they visit an exhibit or museum -- wide-eyed, temporary, forgiven. There is a kind of freedom in that. You can be ignorant and call it charm. You can misread everything and leave before it has consequences.

But I wasn't here for a week. I was there for months. I came alone, with almost no Japanese, and with the quiet certainty of a first breakup that arrived a month into the summer. The city did not greet me as a guest. It simply continued, swallowed me whole, and I had to keep up. 

The first night I arrived, I couldn't find my Airbnb. I walked the block twice, misread the entrances, slipped into the wrong building. There was a FamilyMart on the corner and a narrow back alley that smelled like damp concrete. I messaged the host. Again. And again, until I found the door. 

And in the small room I had rented in a city where I was functionally illiterate, I did the most GenZ thing possible: immediately checking the Wi-Fi. It flicked and failed. I stood hunched near the entrance, where the signal was barely alive, and called my concerned mother over WhatsApp. 

And that was just the beginning. 

Not the internship. Not the sightseeing. Not the friendships I would later make. This was the beginning: the comforts I usually carried—language, familiarity, the ability to disappear—were gone.

It was better than last summer's place in San Francisco's financial district by a lot. But it still wasn't much.

A yellow air conditioner that never stopped working. Slippers waiting at the door. A fridge the color of cheap mint. A TV that I never used. And a closet so shallow it felt like the room was telling me, early, not to unpack.

And that kept happening this summer—familiar outlines showing up in new places. It wasn’t fate. It was just something repeating, and I kept noticing it.

Andy is building a humanoid company in Japan from scratch. Not "In Japan" as a vibe but as in suppliers, visas, language, parts that don't arrive, company structure, culture, etc. 

One afternoon, we were all in the meeting area discussing the number of degrees of freedom in the robot's foot. Masato-san suggested four -- start with a simple toy model and study it before enlarging it. Research-wise, it made a lot of sense. And my experience trying to train policies seemed to support it. 

Andy listened and kindly said "this is engineering management 101". 

Four isn't wrong, but it's slow. I've always liked the "start simple" story because it feels clean, almost academic. Andy's point was more practical: in hardware, "simple first" can turn into doing everything twice. Another round of parts that don't arrive, another vendor loop, another build you still have to ship.

I liked the phrase _genchi genbutsu_ because it sounds stricter than how I usually live. Not morally—just practically. Less negotiable. It points at places where being wrong costs something and you don't get to talk your way out of it. 

One of the members who currently works on computer vision told me about his earlier years in manufacturing. He described handling molten metal in the Toyota assembly lines, managing timing and temperature. He didn’t present it as a lesson, but to me it made _genchi genbutsu_ click: learning under conditions where errors show up immediately. Stuff like that changed what I take seriously. It shrinks the range of things you can pretend are fine.

I didn’t realize it right away. It showed up on the walk home, passing the same vending machines I'd started using like mile markers. 

Tokyo had a way of quieting the background noise for me. When the city stopped asking me to perform, I could hear myself more clearly. I saw how quickly I reach for "nonstandardness." Some of it is real curiosity. Some of it—if I'm being honest—is cover. A way to stay convincing to myself while calling it ambition. 

What bothered me was that the desire hadn't changed—only the reason underneath it. Sometimes I can't tell whether I'm pulled by the work itself or by something more embarrassing: fear of being ordinary, hunger for story, imitation that looks like taste from the inside. I don't know what mix of that I'm made of. I just know that when I'm unsure what matters, I get restless in a way that eventually forces me to move. 

_Genchi genbutsu_ isn’t only about factories. It’s a rule against living through substitutes. I’m good at staying one step removed; if something stays debatable, I can keep it comfortable. The moments I remember from this summer weren’t like that. They had a kind of bluntness to them. Whatever I told myself afterward didn’t change what happened. 

In San Francisco—at least in the crypto rooms I was in—a lot of things moved on vibes. I could feel myself tracking the same signals everyone else was tracking: which VCs were circling, who was tweeting, what the narrative sounded like on Hacker News. It felt like momentum, even before anything had really been materially tested. I don’t mean that cynically. That’s just what it feels like when attention moves faster than reality.

Japan isn't just a new aesthetic, but I did learn a stricter definition of real. If I'm serious about creating things that matter, I have to go the place where the thing either functions or it doesn't. 

> Earlier this term, I visited a local [HVAC conference](https://www.ihacitradeshow.com/) and learned about the industry by talking with technicians, engineers, and private-equity investors. From the top down, the language was financial—EBITDA, rollups, multiples. From the bottom up, it was personal: who you trusted, who returned your calls, who you’d let into your house. Entire distributors ran on those relationships. The spreadsheets mattered, but the business held together because people knew each other.


# liminal spaces

This summer has felt like a liminal space in a peculiar way: not between places but between forms of belonging. 

Nothing broke but things simply stretched and slowly eroded. I found myself talking to people I care about less often, not because the connection mattered less, but because the effort required to maintain it had increased just enough to be felt. I think this is a small glimpse into what post-college friendships will be like. 

At the same time, I made a bunch of new friends in Tokyo! People around my age, many orbiting the city's growing startup ecosystem. Half were internationals and the other half natives. Proximity did the work that distance had been undoing elsewhere (ironically there was a hackerhouse adjoined to the Airbnb I was staying at). 

This liminal stretch has changed how I relate to risk. I'm less concerned with preserving coherence, less careful about protecting the shape of a life that made sense on paper. What matters now is contact -- situations where decisions have (literal) weight, where outcomes aren't rhetorical, where I don't get to explain myself afterward. 

Distance has already done a quiet sorting. One thread with a close friend slowed to monthly-ish check-ins. New ones formed without effort [^1]. Along the way, a lot of ideas I'd been carrying about identity, success, and ambition have lost their hold. Not dramatically but they just stopped feeling necessary. 

[^1]: I regularly talk to an older online tech friend from Australia now :)


I want to do things without guarding every edge. The upside isn't polish but the kind of [asymmetry](https://fooledbyrandomness.com/ConvexityScience.pdf) that Nassim Taleb writes about, where volatility teaches instead of eroding. This summer loosened the gravity of an identity that I've worked within for a significant part of my life. Now what remains feels lighter, but also more deliberate.

</div>


What comes next is staying in this discomfort long enough for it to be useful—trying things without knowing where they lead, and letting the work, not the narrative, decide what lasts. I want to build a life that makes that kind of trial possible, with enough stability to persist and enough exposure to be changed by what I’m doing.
