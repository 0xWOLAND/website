# some ramblings

i told one of my close friends that i would write a blog post about my summer in tokyo. here i am sitting in the tokyo metropolitan library, and i'm finally getting around to it. on the way here, there were a number of primary schools and playgrounds with kids playing baseball and running around. it was a little jarring because it was so different from what i was used to for basically the entire time i've been here. but at the same time, it was reminiscent of not only my childhood but somewhat of my life prior to the last year. much has changed since then, but the last few months more than ever before. the summer has forced me to grow up a lot both in terms of my work and my personal life, so sitting in a place like this is a little surreal.

_here i am writing this irl. i'm not sure how i feel about it._

# the promise

when i first mentioned that i was coming to tokyo for the summer, a lot of people were surprised but were excited for me. perhaps more than myself but it could be that i am numb to these kinds of things. i've been here for a little over 3 months now, and i've been to a number of places. i've made a lot of friends, and i've learned a lot about myself. a lot of people that i know travel to japan for vacation, running around being the obnoxious _gaijin_ that they are. but there si something liberating in that -- being just the dumb tourist who doesn't have to bare the consequences after a couple of weeks tops. but i was set to come here for a few months: far longer of a timeframe. and that too, i came alone without speaking the langauge at all. additionally, i had some personal matters to tend to, so this was perhaps the most isolated i've ever been. at least for the first few months, it was challenging to adjust.  

i lived in an aribnb in the middle of roppongi -- eight minutes from the office, close enough to pretend the distance wouldn't matter (i would regularly end up rushing to the office in the mornings after sleeping in accidentally).

finding it the first night was really hard. i circled the block twice, accidentally entering a building that later would be the place i met many great friends. same familymart on the corner, and foul backalley. after a few messages with my host deki on airbnb, i finally found it.  

as someone who is chronically online, the first thing i checked was the wifi. tokyo has public networks everywhere, so i assumed that was the plan. but when i went to my room, i had nothing but a flickering connection. consequently, i awkwardly stood by the entrancehunched in a corner just to whatsapp call my mom, for which i heard an earful lol.

    <i>i still can't believe i brought a crushed belvita all the way from austin. it was multiple years old and unfortunately was my first meal in tokyo. i'm not sure how it survived the flight.</i>
</div>

it beat last summer's SF place (which was a tiny room i was renting for 1k in FiDi) by orders-of-magnitude. but it wasn't much: a yellow air-con that hummed like a vending machine, tatami-soled slippers at teh door, a small light-green fridge, a small TV, a bidet (god bless), and a shallow closet (more on this).

it's wild how the same banksy plastered on the side of a wall near the bridge in downtown austin is the same one that hangs above the tv in my room. it reminds of this one naval quote that keeps jumping into my head:

>  "history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes."

or something like that.

> the contour of the black and white used to color the girl reads as something that has been left unwritten (maybe left to be filled out?). it also feels as if carries grief/absence in its solid grading (perhaps the most poignant part of the piece). at each point in my life when this image popped up, it was when i was trying to fill out the blank spaces in my life. at first it was doing something that i _thought_ would be something i would enjoy (and would look good on my college apps) and would learn a lot from. and now it's came up when i am introspecting on my life and human connection -- thematic of reorienting myself.

> the red is striking and saturated (and imperfect in the austin piece). it's the only loud thing that immediately jumps out at me. it represents life bursting with color and emotion, but its also slipping away...seems fitting. together, it is a story of life/hope drifting away from the uncolored self, and whether it's worth it to chase after it.

in high school i optimized for having a unique set of experiences _but_ still clearing the normal competence bar of olympiads/research. but now its not just resume/a list of accomplishments but the full game of life. its the same game engine but rerun with different aims: 
- detect the perceived lack
- make it a game/RL environment
- optimize with many training epochs 
- converge

tokyo's quiet and restlessness make the defaults loud. but how much of this obsession with nonstandardness was curiosity and how much was cope, and how much was memetic desire. not sure. i wonder if i can keep up the grind but drop the costume of being an austistic engineer, or at least be much more than that. 

> same desires but different motivations.  

the new move isn't to abandone competence but to decouple it from identity. it should be yet another tool rather than the mask. i want to use the saem energy at things with no badge: authentic friendship, boredom without panic, attention that isn't performantive. the rhyme remains equipped with a new chorus. 

# on the game 

<!-- at first i thought i wanted to be the one dedicated my entire life to solving the biggest problems in math/cs i could think of. P = NP! stuff like this. because it is something that is infinitely rewarding, i alone will be able to hold something that i know wouldn't exist in teh world without me, but also be part of a long tradition of brilliant minds. the historicity of this was enamoring, but also the implications. if, just if, i could make a dent in such huge problems, it would be increidble. and i thought i was working on teh right sort of stuff in theoretical computer science and cryptography, equippred with the mathematical background now to converse in mathematical jargon but also the capability to put that in code

but then my summer got cut and then i ended up in sf working at a crypto startup. prior to that i didn't really know anyone in san francisco or didn't really know how the tech vc world operated. i knew one friend who  -->

A delicate balance that changes over time.

i think there is a very delicate balance

and the balance changes over time (its probably better to lean towards exploration earlier on but too much is also bad because social networks compound in density over time)
