<h2 id="moneros-limitations">Monero’s Limitations</h2>
<p>One of the most fascinating developments in cryptocurrency has been the class of privacy-focused cryptoassets. Monero currently dominates this category in terms of usage (market cap of $6.73B and 24h volume of $110.49M) but it is not without its limitations.</p>
<p>Monero’s ring signature system provides each transaction input with a ring of decoy outputs plus their real one. In theory, an observer shouldn’t tell which output in the ring was actually spent. But in practice, <strong>set intersection attacks</strong> and other heuristics have exposed limitations in their privacy model.</p>
<p>In a set intersection attack, an adversary analyzes multiple transactions whose rings share common outputs in order to distinguish real spends by intersecting these sets. For example, suppose that Alice owns an old Monero output <span class="math inline">A</span>. She spends it in a transaction on the main Monero chain forming a ring</p>
<p><span class="math display">
    \text{Tx1} = \{A, B, C, D, E\}
</span></p>
<p>Because of Monero’s ring signature, an observer can’t tell which of the five is the real input. Now suppose Alice also spends the same output on a Monero fork:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
    \text{Tx1'} = \{F, G, A, H, I\}
</span></p>
<p>Each ring has 5 outputs, but <span class="math inline">A</span> is the only one common in both, which isn’t good. In Monero, a user’s true spend should be computationally hidden among many decoys, but the <em>re-use</em> of the same output across multiple rings breaks this illusion. According to a recent review by Cypher Stack, this remains a practical <a href="https://moneroresearch.info/index.php?action=resource_RESOURCEVIEW_CORE&amp;id=235#">attack vector</a>.</p>
<p>Reusing decoys in Monero has some serious ripple effects. If the real spend for a single output is ever revealed—through an exchange, user mistake, or clever analysis—it doesn’t just affect that one transaction. It lets anyone rule out that output as a decoy in any other ring it appeared in. That, in turn, helps narrow down the real spends in those rings, and the process can repeat across the network. In Monero’s early days, this was especially bad—over 65% of inputs didn’t even use decoys, so they were trivially exposed. And even after mixins were added, researchers found that another ~22% of inputs could still be traced just by overlapping the right rings and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/338.pdf#:~:text=%1Brst%20heuristic%20,any%20ground%20truth%20on%20RingCTs">eliminating possibilities</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more troubling is that a powerful attacker could add their own known decoys to the ring. By flooding the network with transactions that reuse known or controlled outputs as decoys, they can “poison” the anonymity set. Once a few real spends are known, these poisoned rings make it much easier to strip away decoys and trace other transactions. It creates a chain reaction where even users who took care to protect their privacy can end up exposed if their transactions enter rings with adversaries.</p>
<p>This set-intersection effect accurately explains why <strong>churning</strong>—the practice of sending funds back to yourself to “clean” them—is especially dangerous in Monero, and why any privacy leak (such as using a KYC exchange or revealing a single address) can compromise not just a single transaction but the entire anonymity set. When a user spends funds that were previously used in a public or traceable context, it contaminates any ring that output appears in. Even indirect interactions with centralized services, or careless use of wallets that expose scanning patterns, can cascade into de-anonymizing dozens or hundreds of other users.</p>
<p>What’s especially troubling is that normal users—people just trying to move their money or use an exchange—can unknowingly weaken the privacy of the entire network. Every time someone reveals a spend, even unintentionally, it shrinks the effective anonymity set for everyone else. Over time, these small leaks accumulate, and the network becomes easier to analyze. In Monero, privacy erosion isn’t always caused by attackers—it can emerge organically from the way the system works.</p>

<p>Modern Monero has strengthened its defenses against intersection attacks, though primarily through patches rather than rigorous cryptographic guarantees. Techniques like enforcing minimum ring sizes and refining decoy selection help mitigate “closed set” intersection attacks, where outputs only appear with each other and can thus be linked. Although these measures have made analysis harder than in Monero’s early days—when researchers could deanonymize up to 90% of transactions for just <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/455.pdf">~$1,000</a>—a well-resourced adversary with enough data can <em>still</em> perform large-scale intersection attacks.</p>

<h2 id="zcashs-mathematical-guarantees">Zcash’s Mathematical Guarantees</h2>
<p>Unlike Monero, Zcash doesn’t rely on probabilistic arguments with decoys. Instead, it achieves <strong>ledger indistinguishability</strong> using zero-knowledge proofs. Every shielded transaction in Zcash is cryptographically indistinguishable from random noise. And now, it is being accelerated in Zcash Engineer Sean Bowe’s <a href="https://seanbowe.com/blog/tachyon-scaling-zcash-oblivious-synchronization/">Project Tachyon</a>. Succinctly, here is how Tachyon addresses the limitations of Monero:</p>

<p>In Project Tachyon, Bowe rethinks how wallets sync and interact with blockchain state in a secure manner. Tachyon introduces a model where wallets maintain a proof of their own synchronization (via <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/61151">proof-carrying data</a>), allowing validators to prune almost all historic data. By shifting secret distribution off-chain and removing reliance on encrypted note payloads in the ledger, it enables lean, stateless wallets and small, efficient blocks.</p>
<p>Where Monero’s privacy degrades as the network grows—due to increasing chain bloat, repeated decoy reuse, and compounding intersection attacks—Tachyon pushes Zcash in the opposite direction: greater usage yields greater efficiency/security. In effect, Monero’s scale is a liability, while Zcash’s scale becomes a strength. Tachyon turns what is traditionally a privacy trade-off into a privacy advantage.</p>
