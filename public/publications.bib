	abstract = {We study a fundamental challenge in the economics of innovation: an inventor must reveal details of a new idea to secure compensation or funding, yet such disclosure risks expropriation. We present a model in which a seller (inventor) and buyer (investor) bargain over an information good under the threat of hold-up. In the classical setting, the seller withholds disclosure to avoid misappropriation, leading to inefficiency. We show that trusted execution environments (TEEs) combined with AI agents can mitigate and even fully eliminate this hold-up problem. By delegating the disclosure and payment decisions to tamper-proof programs, the seller can safely reveal the invention without risking expropriation, achieving full disclosure and an efficient ex post transfer. Moreover, even if the invention's value exceeds a threshold that TEEs can fully secure, partial disclosure still improves outcomes compared to no disclosure. Recognizing that real AI agents are imperfect, we model "agent errors" in payments or disclosures and demonstrate that budget caps and acceptance thresholds suffice to preserve most of the efficiency gains. Our results imply that cryptographic or hardware-based solutions can function as an "ironclad NDA," substantially mitigating the fundamental disclosure-appropriation paradox first identified by Arrow (1962) and Nelson (1959). This has far-reaching policy implications for fostering R\&D, technology transfer, and collaboration.},

	shorttitle = {Myco},
	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/687},
	abstract = {As billions of people rely on end-to-end encrypted messaging, the exposure of metadata, such as communication timing and participant relationships, continues to deanonymize users. Asynchronous metadata-hiding solutions with strong cryptographic guarantees have historically been bottlenecked by quadratic \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ server computation in the number of users \$N\$ due to reliance on private information retrieval (PIR). We present Myco, a metadata-private messaging system that preserves strong cryptographic guarantees while achieving \$O(N {\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 N)\$ efficiency. To achieve this, we depart from PIR and instead introduce an oblivious data structure through which senders and receivers privately communicate. To unlink reads and writes, we instantiate Myco in an asymmetric two-server distributed-trust model where clients write messages to one server tasked with obliviously transmitting these messages to another server, from which clients read. Myco achieves throughput improvements of up to 302x over multi-server and 2,219x over single-server state-of-the-art systems based on PIR.},
